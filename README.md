# Secure Password System

A simple CLI-based authentication system that securely stores and verifies user passwords using salted hashing.

---

## Features
- Password hashing using SHA-256
- Random salt generation for each user
- Secure password verification
- Menu-driven registration and login system

---

## Security Concepts Used
- Hashing
- Salting
- Authentication logic
- Avoids storing plain-text passwords

---

## How to Run
```bash
python secure_password_system.py# secure_password_system
A secure Python login system that demonstrates safe password handling using salted SHA-256 hashing. It allows user registration and login while ensuring passwords are never stored in plain text. The project illustrates core security concepts such as hashing, salting, and credential verification in a simple CLI workflow.
